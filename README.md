These scripts were written to collect deals from app.jumpsend.com and send filtered deals to a user via email. They were written with no intent to monetize Jump Send's or Amazon's products, and are in no way affiliated with them.

To run the scripts, first edit scrape.py and fill out the parameters at the top, including:
    - The email you would like to use to send the deals from (currently MUST be a gmail account).
    - The password to the sender's email.
    - The email you would like to receive the deals. This can be the same as the sender's email (does NOT have to be a gmail account).

    (Optional)
    - The minimum and maximum prices you would like your deals to be.
    - The minimum and maximum discount percentages you would like your deals.

Once you have the parameters filled out, simply run the scrape.py script ("python scrape.py").
