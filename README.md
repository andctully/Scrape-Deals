These scripts were written to collect deals from a deal website (Jump Send) and send filtered deals to a user via email. They were written with no intent to monetize Jump Send or Amazon's products and are in no way affiliated with them.

The scripts are currently under development, and further instructions will be included once the scripts are completed.
